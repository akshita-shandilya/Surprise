        <h1>Hey Love, There's Something I Need to Say...</h1>
        <p>You have no idea how much I appreciate your forgiveness. It means a lot to me that you understand. Youâ€™re not just my best friend, youâ€™re like family to me. I can always count on you, and that means the world. I feel like I can be my true self around you, no matter what. You accept me completely, flaws and all, and that is the greatest gift I could ever ask for. I know I donâ€™t always say it, but I want you to know you mean everything to me. Youâ€™re not just my best friendâ€”youâ€™re my soulmate in friendship ðŸ’•.</p>
